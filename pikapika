HAROOOOOOO HIBACHI BENIHANI TERIYAKIIII OKALAHOMA NGAKASAKI MITSIBUSHI one direction infectionnnnnnn You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment, in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded
Like tonight's sky
Hands are silent
Voice's numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment, in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
